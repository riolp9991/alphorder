Description: # Alphorder
        
        Alphorder is a tool that allows you to sort your folders with a simple line of code either from the command line or you can import it into your Python project.
        
        # Instalation
        
        You can install alphorder whit **pip** running the following command
        
        ```
        pip install alphorder
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        There are two main ways you can use alphorder, from the comandline and importing it to your proyect.
        
        ## Proyect
        
        You can import alphorder to your proyect with this line of code
        
        ```python
        from alphorder import Alphorder
        ```
        This way you have imported the class that contains the methods to sort your folders
        
        ### Alphabetic order
        
        You can put all the files and folders into the corresponding folder to his name, this mean that if there is a file called **Casa** will me moved to the folder **C**.
        
        All of the numeric starting folders or files will be moved to a folder called **#**.
        
        All of this will be achived bia the method `sort`
        
        ```python
        Alphorder.sort("path/to/folder")
        ```
        
        ### Move to a specific folder
        You can perform the same that before but just for the content that matches one of the keywords that you specifie with the method `moveToFolder`.
        
        The method will receive two params, the first one will be the path of the folder, and the second one will be the folder to move.
        
        > If the second param is not a valid path, then the program will create a folder with the second param as its name and move all the content to it.
        
        ```python
        Alphorder.sort("/path/to/folder", "path/to/second/folder")
        # or you can simply add a word or sentence
        Alphorder.sort("/path/to/folder", "ordenado con alphorder")
        ```
        
        ### Move to a specific folder with params
        You can perform the same that before but just for the content that matches a series one of the keywords that you specifie with the method `moveToFolderByKeywords`
        
        This method will receive a param more that the previous one: an array of strings to match
        
        > The target will be moved if any of the keywords is found on its name
        
        ```python
        Alphorder.sort("/path/to/folder", "second path", ["sort", "alph"])
        ```
        
        ## Commandline
        
        You can use the same methods that on the proyect directly from the commandline with the `alphorder` keyword.
        
        ### Alphabetic order
        
        ```bash
        alphorder "/path/to/folder"
        ```
        
        As you can see is allmost the same as before.
        
        ### Move to a specific folder
        
        As in a proyect you need to specify two params: the main path and the target path.
        
        ```bash
        alphorder "/path/to/folder" "/target/path"
        ```
        
        > If the second param is not an existing folder then a folder with the same name will be created on the main folder
        
        ### Move to a specific folder with params
        
        If you add more params after the two path this ones will be taked as **keywords**, and then just will be moved the files or the folders that **contains** any of the **keywords** in its name
        
        ```bash
        alphorder "/path/to/folder" "/target/path" word1 word2 "sample of a sentence"
        ```
